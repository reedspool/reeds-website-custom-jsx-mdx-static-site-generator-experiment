# Project: Progression Game 

I had an idea for a "game". The idea didn't seem fun in my head. The idea was to just make a way to progress through different screens or states of a minimalist UI. If I could make that, then I'd proceed to make a different minimalist UI with a similar theme, to vary the method of progress. I knew this description was obnoxiously vague, but instead of attempting to describe it I wanted to move forward to programming it.

## Game

<Stage1Button first>Stage 1 - Step 1 (Begin)</Stage1Button>
<Stage1Button>Stage 1 - Step 2</Stage1Button>
<Stage1Button>Stage 1 - Step 3</Stage1Button>
<Stage1Button>Stage 1 - Step 4</Stage1Button>
<Stage1Button>Stage 1 - Step 5</Stage1Button>
<Stage1Button>Stage 1 - Step 6</Stage1Button>
<Stage1Button>Stage 1 - Step 7</Stage1Button>
<Stage1Button last>Stage 1 - Step 8 (You win!)</Stage1Button>

export const Button = ({ children, classes, ...rest }) => 
  <button 
    class={`cpnt-button ${classes}`} 
    {...rest}>
    {children}
  </button>


export const Stage1Button = ({ children, classes, first, last, ...rest }) => 
  <Button 
    classes={`${!first && "hidden"} ${classes}`} 
    _={`${last ? "on click hide me then remove .hidden from next <div />" : "on click hide me then remove .hidden from next <button />"}`}
    {...rest}>
    {children}
  </Button>

<div class="hidden">
  You made it to State 2 somehow. You'd need a miracle to <Stage2Button>progress</Stage2Button>.
</div>

<div class="hidden">Whelp, if that's how it was, then that was the way it would have <Stage2Button>to be</Stage2Button>.</div>

<div class="hidden">But who was to be kind who didn't if allow grose</div>

export const Stage2Button = ({ children, ...rest }) => 
  <Button _={`on click hide the closest <div /> then remove .hidden from next <div />`} {...rest}>{children}</Button>

I played with some ways to progress with the click of a mouse.
