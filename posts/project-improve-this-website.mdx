# Project: Improve This Website

My life is full of web pages. Sometimes I want to make web pages for myself. I want to have a nice home for those pages. So I work to improve this website to make that home nicer over time.

## Criteria

I'll view this project as successful if my site continually improves over time. I don't have any final goal. I just want a personal website which feels nice to me.

## Logbook

My last website used React. I fell in love with JSX and MDX. I wanted to try a website with JSX and MDX without React. And the NakedJSX project seemed to fit my needs perfectly.

I spoke to the developer of NakedJSX on Discord and he walked me through how to make a website that fit some requirements I had:

1. JSX to compile static HTML pages.
1. MDX to write posts in plain text with custom components peppered throughout.
1. A post need only be in the right directory to get compiled without external configuration.

I achieved those goals with the help of the developer. He helped me with explanations of how the software already worked as well as some enhancements. I was grateful for the personal attention. He said he was grateful for the challenges I presented, but I believe I got the better end of the deal.

NakedJSX was pretty fast too. I made 1000 copies of a 2.5kb post file and it took 18.5 seconds to compile the entire site.

These were just the baseline requirements. I also wanted a few more things.

1. To use TailwindCSS
1. To use a development server

### TailwindCSS

I was a fan of Tailwind. To implement it, I thought I 'd need these steps:

1. Copy my existing Tailwind configuration and the basic CSS from my old website (removing any irrelevant styles)
1. Test Tailwind to ensure it generated the CSS correctly
1. Link to the generated CSS file in the HTML template shared by all posts
1. Hook up NakedJSX's build system to Tailwind's, so that they always build at the same time
1. Ideally hook up NakedJSX's development server so that when CSS changes, the page refreshes after building.

So I copied the config JS files and base CSS:

1. `postcss.config.js`
1. `tailwind.config.js`
1. `style.css`

I reviewed all these files and removed a lot of irrelevant or unused kruft.

Then I pulled up the official Tailwind installation instructions to review.

In my previous project, Vite automatically configured PostCSS. So I researched PostCSS to see how I might use it standalone. I wanted to avoid the complication of Vite in this project. I discovered PostCSS's CLI which excited me as I wouldn't have to use any other build tool.

I had to install the PostCSS, its CLI, and a few dependencies that I found useful in the old project:

```
npm install -D postcss postcss-cli postcss-import @tailwindcss/nesting postcss-nesting tailwindcss autoprefixer
```

I wrote a simple command for the PostCSS CLI in `package.json` in the `scripts` section. It just worked and which encouraged me.

```
"build:css": "postcss css/style.css --output build/build.css",
```

I thought I would have to time this with NakedJSX's build system. But it occurred to me once I got PostCSS working that there was no timing conflict. PostCSS could write the output `build.css` and NakedJSX could write the output HTML files. No sweat. I could run both dev servers simultaneously in different processes, and I could run both build commands in sequence or parallel.

Next I had to link the CSS output in the HTML output. This was as easy as adding a single line to my NakedJSX JS files.

```jsx
Page.AppendHead(<link rel="stylesheet" href="./build.css" />);
```

### Development Server

NakedJSX shipped with a dev server when I began to use it. But it did not work perfectly. The issues were that:

1. It regenerated all posts when a post changed.
1. It did not refresh the page when a post changed.

Every time I edited a post, all of the posts were subsequently recompiled. Ideally, only the post I had edited and saved would recompile.

When I edited a file outside my posts directory, the development server would regenerate only that file. That took less than half a second which was nice. But I wanted to focus on writing posts, and that would be slow.

The documentation also promised that the browser page would refresh when the file was recompiled. I didn't experience that on either posts or other JSX files.

The developer was so generous with his time so far. I decided to push all my current work to GitHub and point him to it to ask for his help.

He mentioned an idea: Because my NakedJSX script should always write the output after the input file was last saved, the output file should always be newer than the input. Therefore, I could check each input file against each output file, and only re-compile if the output was older than the input.

So I tried it. I used Node's `fs.access` and `fs.stat` to read the input and the output and determine which was newer. I found the same issue which the NakedJSX developer mentioned. Unfortunately, the development server wouldn't register any files which were not exported, so those files with no changes would never recompile again. To get around this, I wrote imports for each file but included a flag so signal if it should recompile or not.

<span id="all-mjs-cached-by-dev-server">This still did not solve the issue. When one of my post files changed, `all.mjs` was not re-executed. Was its output cached? I added `console.log` messages to `all.mjs`, but I never saw them again after the first build.</span>

As an aside, the development server did not respond to Control-C. Instead, I had to hit "x" to exit the development server. I was so used to Control-C to exit out of other programs, and the lack of response confused me.

Another random issue I experienced was the output of the server sometimes overwrote my `console.log` messages. This limited my basic debugging strategy.

One of the reasons I wanted to avoid React was to focus on writing vanilla JS and CSS for the front-end. I wanted my site to be flexible enough for ad hoc JS experiments so I <Link slug="project-write-script-and-style-tags">tried to write some script tags</Link>. This wasn't as straightforward as I'd hoped in NakedJSX, but I learned a lot.

I also tried out the NakedJSX config file with `npm run build -- --config-save`. This was nice! I'd love to add a switch to this.

<Future>I tried my hand at adding a configuration for turning off the arbitrary attribute validation. Maybe I could configure the allowable characters in an HTML attribute. Also it would be nice to turn the error into a warning because then I could review a report of many such issues instead of stopping processing with the first instance.</Future>

### Thu Aug 24 15:37:02 PDT 2023

I wanted to add links between pages, but I found I was renaming pages frequently in this early stage of development. To lower the friction to name changes, I <GitHubLink extraPath="/blob/main/components/Link.jsx" text="made a component" /> which would throw an error if I used an incorrect name for another post.

<Future>I experimented with `ref` to collect all of the links in each post to create backlinks.</Future>

<Future>I experimented with post-processing the HTML output of NakedJSX with an HTML parser to collect all the links in each post to create back links.</Future>

### Sun Sep 3 10:27:34 PDT 2023

<Future>I wanted a way to collect all the content of all my Future components on the entire site into one place for a high level view of to-dos</Future>

<Future>I wanted a way to collect and view all of the content of my Future components on the page I was looking at at the click of a button</Future>

<Future>To get over the issues with how NakedJSX reported errors in MDX compilation, I made a script to compile all MDX, or a specific MDX page on my site to JSX, without using NakedJSX at all.</Future>

### Mon Sep 4 04:40:02 PM PDT 2023

I investigated why inline components (like my `Link` component) had additional spaces when rendered. I spelunked through the NakedJSX core for a while, but found nothing. Finally, I found it was due to the `pretty` option to NakedJSX which prettified the output HTML. Turning off this option fixed the issue. [I let the developer know](https://discord.com/channels/1101319012673134614/1101319013285498882/1148401967308222474).

My development server did not automatically rebuild pages because of caching as I detailed [here](#all-mjs-cached-by-dev-server). I decided to fix this.

My idea was to write a script to generate a JavaScript file which imported all of my posts and wrote that file to disk. This was basically what the development server was already doing, except it was trying to do it intelligently at run-time. I wanted to do it on demand instead. I'd just have to re-run that script every time I added a new file, which seemed simple enough.

To write <GitHubLink extraPath="/blob/main/bin/generate-post-imports.mjs" text="this script" /> was as easy as copying and pasting the contents of my development server script which essentially did the same thing. I just wrote the result to a file instead of returning it from a dynamic script.

<Future>I found that the NakedJSX development server was not correctly rendering this "link" emoji `ðŸ”—`. This seemed to be a problem only with the development server because the output HTML looked correct and when I served those files with another server, the emoji looked correct.</Future>

### Thu Sep 7 09:50:41 PM PDT 2023

<Future>I fixed the bleed layout which I had imported from my previous site but misused by not applying a top-level class of `cpnt-bleed-layout` anywhere.</Future>

<Future>I added a link to the end of every post page to its file in GitHub</Future>

### Fri Sep 8 06:40:27 PM PDT 2023

I made some changes to my fork of NakedJSX core and installed it as a direct dependency.

```
npm install git+https://github.com/reedspool/nakedjsx-core.git\#reed-hacks
```

There were two commits I wanted. First, I didn't want every bit of JSX to be HTML-escaped for my <Link slug="project-write-script-and-style-tags">script and style tags</Link>. Second, I wanted more permissive HTML attribute validation so I could add an SVG with the standard attribute `xmlns:svg`.

<Future>In my <Link slug="project-precision-timer">precision timer project</Link> I wrote many similar ad-hoc HTML widgets with adjacent script tags to drive the widgets' interactions. Since I was repeating the same widget with minor modifications, I ended up copying and pasting similar code. Each time, I changed a number at the end of each repeated function name as well as class names for targeting associated the HTML elements. So I wondered if I could write a functional wrapper which would give me a unique name/number for each iteration, instead of making the same repetitive change to the numbers for each copy of the code. I was thinking of [`gensym` from Lisp macros](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59493183). I wasn't sure how this would work in JSX.</Future>

<Future>I wanted to improve my `Future` component to style it differently from the prose around it.</Future>

<Future>I wanted to improve my `Future` component to add a link to an explanation of why I wrote something I'd never done in the past tense.</Future>

<Future>I made a `script` tag component wrapper that allowed me to write as if I was using a simple `script` tag and also put a widget in the document flow which could expand to present the same code to the reader.</Future>

<Future>I wanted code on my website to be formatted well with line numbers such as it might in a code editor. I knew of many code editor libraries for the front-end. The best one I was aware of was CodeMirror after some research I did previously for [Hedy](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/issues/3823).</Future>


### Sun Sep 17 02:25:14 AM PDT 2023

I began to work on <Link slug="project-add-rss">RSS for my website which Bryan had asked me for repeatedly.</Link>


### Tue Oct 10 10:26:05 PM PDT 2023

<Future>I wanted a list of all the posts on my site which were not linked anywhere so I could add new posts at-will and remember to add links to them later.</Future> 


### Sat Oct 14 12:47:38 AM PDT 2023

I made a new <Link slug="topic-operating-this-website">page to document the processes I use to run this website</Link> because I feared for a future when I forgot exactly how to make a new page.

### Sat Oct 14 10:45:08 AM PDT 2023

I wanted a cleaner git diff for my generated file when I added a new post, so I changed from numeric, arbitrary import names to names associated with the actual file.

### Sun Nov  5 08:47:26 PM PST 2023

I made a new 
<Link slug="project-supabase-authentication">project to try Supabase authentication</Link>.

### Wed Nov 15 12:15:25 AM PST 2023

<Future>I wanted to publish password-encrypted pages on my website alongside my public posts. I considered encrypting files in my public site repository on GitHub, via https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt or similar, but it seemed simpler to pull the files from an external, private source. I could pull the files at build-time on Netlify. Then I still needed a solution to encrypt a webpage's contents there, then decrypt the webpage after one entered a password on the browser. One such option was https://github.com/Greenheart/pagecrypt.</Future> 

<HashTarget id="exploring-client-side-js-in-nakedjsx">Exploring client-side JS in NakedJSX</HashTarget>

### Sat Nov 18 05:49:52 PM PST 2023

I wanted to style and shape my client-side UI and text more easily, so I looked up how to use client-side JSX via NakedJSX, the library my site was built upon. The [documentation](https://nakedjsx.org/documentation/#client-js-jsx) was a little confusing. It proposed there was no special thing I needed to do to use JSX in my client-side JavaScript, but I found that hard to believe. I tried it out right here.

```
<div client-side-jsx-test></div> 
<script contenteditable class="block">document.querySelector('[client-side-jsx-test]').appendChild(<div>My div</div>)</script>
```

It didn't work! I got an error like `undefined token <`, meaning the JSX wasn't converted. I tried following the docs more literally. I made a new `-client.jsx` file to mirror the `-page.jsx` file which compiled this page. Then I added a literal `Page.AppendBody` call exactly as the example in the documentation suggested. That did work. Whew. Then I tried taking the content from that `Page.AppendBody` and put it directly in this MDX file like so:

```
<p onclick="this.appendChild(<JsxTag count={++clickCounter}/>); console.log(this); console.log({ hello: 'world', self: this })">Click Me!</p>
```

And again, that worked. Yay! So I suspected this only worked with the `onClick` method. I tried using the `raw-content` tag to test that theory, and it did not work:

```
<raw-content content='<script type="module">document.body.appendChild(<JsxTag count={++clickCounter}/>)</script>' />
```

I experimented with the `Page.AppendJs` syntax and I was able to make a global function which appended a JSX element. Nice.

I had a circuitous idea to achieve my goal of writing client-side JSX inline in my MDX articles: export a function from MDX, then import it along with the rest of my MDX file, and finally include it in the compiled page via `Page.AppendJs`. I got close, but the JSX wasn't transformed into JavaScript the way it was in `-client.jsx` and other literal calls to `Page.AppendJs`. 

So I had a way forward, but it unfortunately involved authoring my client-side JavaScript in a separate file. I reported my results to the author of NakedJSX and we had a nice chat about it.

<Future>After chatting with the creator of NakedJSX about my goals of writing more inline JavaScript and JSX for both the client and statically-generated server-side, he helped me understand that I might want to write my own implementation of a static site generator with vanilla JSX. [He gave me some pointers of how I might do that](https://discord.com/channels/1101319012673134614/1101319013285498882/1175275036312092722) and I committed to trying it out sometime in the future.</Future>

On a different topic, I added the ability to my `Link` component to target an ID on an internal page (`HashTarget`) so that I could track my usage of internal links to specific places. 

### Thu Nov 23 15:48:27 PST 2023

<Future>

I made a component to formalize and feel out my use of two links to source files in this ite. One link was local for me to navigate with my text editor's path-following feature. The other link was for someone viewing the website to see my source codes in GitHub. I thought that I would like to only supply the local path, because then my existing text editor path-following would work. Then, the component could derive the appropriate GitHub path from that local path. I didn't know how to solve this technically, because I didn't know how the component could introspect on the name and current path of the file in which the component was used. Maybe the component could be bound to those props at runtime by the compile page, e.g.:

```
const MyInternalGitHubLink = bindProps(InternalGitHubLink, { filePath: "posts/sub-posts" });
```

so that my component could convert `../../src/filename.jsx` to `src/filename.jsx` and derive `https://github.com/reedspool/reeds-website/blob/main/src/filename.jsx` by tacking it onto the normal GitHub base link.

Previously, I had been typing both links and both paths in Markdown, like this:

```
[here (local, won't work on the web)](../src/compile-all-posts-client.jsx) or [here (global, GitHub)](https://github.com/reedspool/reeds-website/blob/main/src/compile-all-posts-client.jsx#L1)
```

Though I had also worked a bit on a component for linking to my GitHub, `GitHubLink`. I'm not sure what I hoped to gain with that component.

I realized that my `Link` component had a similar issue: at this point, it only accounted for `href`'s in the same directory, with no slashes. To cover the use case of linking to-and-from non-blog pages, it would need to know where it was being used.
</Future>

### Tue Nov 28 10:41:46 PM PST 2023

<Future>I had a specific issue prototyping with the NakedJSX's client side scripting method. The issue as I saw it was that I wanted to write all of my code in public. When I opened the dev tools on my web page, I wanted the maximum access to everything I was working on. I might want to try out some code or otherwise. The rule of encapsulation makes sense for shared code libraries. But when I make an application, that's not shared code! I do want shared code to encapsulate and not pollute the global name-space, whether I write the code to be shared or bring the code in. But I want my tools to be available to me easily. To be  specific, I do not like having to explicitly attach a function the window object for it to be global. I want global to be the default on all the code I'm writing.</Future>

### Fri Dec  8 08:13:24 PM PST 2023

<Future>I thought readers of my website might appreciate if my logbooks were in reverse chronological order instead of beginning-to-end. Maybe a button to reverse that order could be useful too. I thought I might be able to use CSS to reverse the visual order of each. Though for that I would probably need to convert my simple Markdown title+paragraph format for a JSX Logbook component with sub-LogbookEntry items. That way, I would be able to wrap each entry in custom HTML to target with my CSS.</Future> 

I wrote a small script to create a new project file since there were a handful of rote automate-able steps.

### Wed Dec 13 03:55:00 PM PST 2023

<Future>I wanted to write a thought down for an exploration in the future, but it didn't match any f my exact projects. This was the second time this had happened in a short while. Outside of this website, I had used GTD systems for a long time. I was old-hat and automatic at finding the right inbox for the thought on the top of my head, much like reflexively sprinting to the toilet when you feel like you need to vomit. I wondered where and how I could use this website as an inbox. For what ideas would this be the right venue? This would be a fun thing to add, so I could go to my own website more to use it.</Future>

### Tue Dec 19 04:47:33 PM PST 2023

<Future>I thought about literate programming and I wondered if my new JSX implementation was positioned well for experiments with LP. Could I write an MDX article where I build up code and then run that code? Either on my computer or in the browser window? I already had a version of running code from my experiments with `script` elements. I wondered if I could extend that to  also create runnable code in my computer if I wrote a separate compilation script for that separate target. It was a pie-in-the-sky idea, and not well defined within my fuzzy brain.</Future>
