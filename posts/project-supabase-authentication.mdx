# Project: Authenticate with Supabase

I wanted to experiment with [Supabase](https://supabase.com) authentication on this website.

I made a new project on Supabase and read some of their helpful Authentication documentation. I wanted to experiment with it hear so I installed their JavaScript library in my website via a CDN 

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
```

The text below will change to reflect whether the library is loaded right now.

<span>Checking if Supabase is loaded...</span>

<raw-content content={`
  <script>
  {
  let message = "Supabase is NOT loaded";
  if (supabase) message = "Supabase is loaded!"
  document.currentScript.previousElementSibling.innerText = message;
  }
  </script>
`} />
