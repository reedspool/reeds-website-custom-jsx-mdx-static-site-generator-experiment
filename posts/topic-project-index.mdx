# All Projects

I like to make small experiments and track larger efforts. I try to link to all of them here which is <Link slug="projects-on-this-site">a project in itself</Link>.

One of my ongoing projects is to <Link slug="project-improve-this-website">improve this website</Link>.

It took some effort to work out <Link slug="project-write-script-and-style-tags">how to write ad-hoc `script` and `style` tags in JSX and MDX</Link> so I could do experiments with the comfort of markdown and components.

I <Link slug="project-add-popout">experimented with the idea of a pop-out</Link> to collect widgets from around a page to keep them visible.

I tried to make a <Link slug="project-precision-timer">precision timer in JavaScript</Link>.

I finally <Link slug="project-add-rss">added an RSS feed</Link> to this site.

I tried writing <Link slug="project-fizzbuzz-in-css">FizzBuzz in CSS</Link>.

I attempted a <Link slug="project-symbolic-differentiator">symbolic differentiator</Link>.

I tried to add <Link slug="project-supabase-authentication">Supabase authentication</Link> to my site.

I started playing <Link slug="project-dnd-game-2023">a DnD game</Link>.

I started to make a narrative browser <Link slug="project-log-game">game about an interactive chat log</Link> after I had ruminated on it for a while. 

I explored lessons which I could take back from <Link slug="project-hyperscript-and-vanilla-js">Hyperscript to JavaScript</Link>.

I expressed some thoughts about <Link slug="project-codeable-shareable-webpage">a codeable, shareable webpage. Like Codepen but with more control on the entire page.</Link>

I started playing with the idea of <Link slug="project-progression-game">progression in games</Link>

I began to work on a <Link slug="project-new-static-site-generator">new site generator</Link> for my website (this website) with a custom implementation of JSX instead of NakedJSX
