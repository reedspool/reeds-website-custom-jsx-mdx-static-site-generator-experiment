# Recurse Center

My friend Bryan Braun recommended I apply. I'd heard about RC before but didn't consider it for myself for whatever reason. I'm thankful to Bryan for the shift in my opinion.

I accepted the offer to join the first Winter cohort of 2024 this week. I'd like to be on-site at the Brooklyn location for some part of it.

While I figure out how I'll get to and live in Brooklyn I also have to work out a project to focus on when I begin there. I have several ideas.

One idea is to enable myself to edit this very website from a browser. Currently I edit it in Emacs or Vi. But I like to look at it on the web, so I'd like to edit it there too. There are good code editor components for JavaScript already like CodeMirror. But there are many questions I don't have straightforward answers for. How would I edit the site given that it's written in MDX? It's not WYSIWYG. The source code of my site is not the same as the HTML and CSS and JS which is displayed on the browser. And then, once I've made some edit to that source, how would I persist it? Currently I store my site in git, on GitHub. Could I still do that? Or would I need another storage method like a document store?
