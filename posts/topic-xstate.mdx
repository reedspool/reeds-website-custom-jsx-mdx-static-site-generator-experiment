Today I saw the [announcement for XState v5](https://stately.ai/blog/2023-12-01-xstate-v5). I wanted to take some notes as I read so I started this page.

I was very excited to see the Actor Model was the focus of the new package, since the original talks of the actor model in vv4 had ignited a strong interest in that for me, and recently I had been circling back to exploring the actor model and how it applies to <Link slug="project-hyperscript-and-vanilla-js">Hyperscript</Link>.

I recorded and linked to more projects in which I had used XState in the past.

I used it to make a programming language.
