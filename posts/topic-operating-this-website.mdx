# Topic: Operating This Website

## Development Environment Setup

Node and NPM required. `npm install` to install local development environment.

`npm run build` to build production site into `build/` directory.

Run `npm run start` and `npm run start:css` in separate terminals at the same time.

## Deployment

Netlify automatically deploys the `main` branch from <GitHubLink /> every push.

## Making a new post

1. Make a new file under the `posts` directory with an `.mdx` suffix.
2. Restart the dev server (`npm run start`) to regenerate the static post import file.
3. Create a new entry in the `slugs` data in `Link.jsx`.
4. Link to your new page from somewhere with the `<Link slug="...">` component.

I created this page to document some common processes I use on this website. I also linked to the source code's root README file to this page. instead of repeating content like dev environment setup.
